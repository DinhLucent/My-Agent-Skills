I want a CTO-style improvement plan for this repository.

Please:
1. Assess the current system honestly.

3. Identify the highest-leverage improvement areas.
4. Split the plan into quick wins, medium refactors, and major redesigns.
5. Tell me what should not be touched yet.
6. Give me a realistic execution order.`
